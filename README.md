# Secure-Image-Steganography
This project enhances data security by encrypting messages using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange and AES-256 encryption, then embedding them into images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. The hidden message remains undetectable, ensuring secure and private communication.

 Features

ECDH for Secure Key Exchange – Prevents eavesdropping attacks.
AES-256 Encryption – Protects hidden messages from unauthorized access.
LSB Steganography – Embeds encrypted messages into images without visual distortion.
SSIM & PSNR Image Analysis – Verifies image quality after encoding.
Automated Key Handling – Keys are securely stored in text files for easy access.
